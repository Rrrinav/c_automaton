      <h1>Class 4 Cellular Automata: Complex, Computation-Universal Systems</h1>

      <p>
        <span className="bold-text">Class 4 Cellular Automata</span> are known for their complex behavior, which balances between order and randomness. These automata can produce highly intricate patterns, including localized structures that interact in complex ways. Class 4 automata are particularly notable because they are believed to be capable of universal computation, meaning they can simulate any other computational system.
      </p>

      <h2>Characteristics of Class 4 Cellular Automata</h2>
      <p>
        Cellular automata in this class exhibit several defining characteristics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="bold-text">Complex Patterns:</span> Class 4 automata generate intricate, dynamic patterns that neither stabilize quickly nor devolve into chaos. These patterns often involve interacting structures or gliders.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold-text">Long Transients:</span> The evolution of Class 4 automata may involve long transient phases where complex patterns evolve over time before potentially settling into a periodic or stable state.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold-text">Computation-Universal:</span> Some Class 4 automata, like Rule 110, are capable of universal computation, making them theoretically as powerful as any digital computer.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The complexity and computational power of Class 4 automata make them a subject of significant interest in the study of cellular automata and computational theory. They are often studied in the context of emergent behavior, where simple rules lead to unexpectedly complex phenomena.
      </p>

      <h2>Rule 110: A Prime Example of Class 4 Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        <span className="bold-text">Rule 110</span> is one of the most well-known examples of a Class 4 cellular automaton. It is particularly famous because it has been proven to be Turing complete, meaning it can perform any computation that a universal Turing machine can, given the right initial conditions.
      </p>

      <h3>Understanding Rule 110</h3>
      <p>
        Rule 110 operates on a one-dimensional binary grid, where each cell can be in one of two states: 0 (off) or 1 (on). The state of each cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the states of its immediate neighbors (one to the left and one to the right). The update rules for Rule 110 are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If a cell and its two neighbors are in the configuration 111, the next state of the cell is 0.</li>
        <li>If a cell and its two neighbors are in the configuration 110, the next state of the cell is 1.</li>
        <li>If a cell and its two neighbors are in the configuration 101, the next state of the cell is 1.</li>
        <li>If a cell and its two neighbors are in the configuration 100, the next state of the cell is 0.</li>
        <li>If a cell and its two neighbors are in the configuration 011, the next state of the cell is 1.</li>
        <li>If a cell and its two neighbors are in the configuration 010, the next state of the cell is 1.</li>
        <li>If a cell and its two neighbors are in the configuration 001, the next state of the cell is 1.</li>
        <li>If a cell and its two neighbors are in the configuration 000, the next state of the cell is 0.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Despite the simple rule set, Rule 110 produces a rich variety of patterns, including structures that persist and interact over long periods, making it a model of complex behavior in cellular automata.
