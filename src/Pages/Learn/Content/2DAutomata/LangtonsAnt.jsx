      <h1>Langton's Ant: A Simple Turing Machine</h1>
      <p>
        <span className="bold-text">Langton's Ant</span> is a fascinating
        example of a two-dimensional Turing machine. Invented by Chris Langton
        in 1986, this automaton demonstrates how a very simple set of rules can
        lead to surprisingly complex behavior.
      </p>

      <h2>How Langton's Ant Works</h2>
      <p>
        Langton's Ant operates on an infinite grid of square cells, each of
        which can be either black (1) or white (0). The ant moves according to
        the following simple rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="bold-text">White Cell:</span> Turn right, flip the
          cell color to black, and move forward one cell.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold-text">Black Cell:</span> Turn left, flip the
          cell color to white, and move forward one cell.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These rules result in a dynamic and evolving pattern as the ant
        traverses the grid, flipping cells and changing direction based on the
        color of the cell it lands on.
      </p>

      <h2>Emergent Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        Despite the simplicity of its rules, Langton's Ant exhibits a wide range
        of behaviors. Initially, the ant moves chaotically, but after a period
        of random movement, it starts to form a repeating pattern known as a
        "highway." This pattern grows indefinitely in one direction,
        demonstrating how complexity can emerge from simplicity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This emergent behavior is a key area of interest in cellular automata
        theory and complex systems, highlighting how simple rules can create
        intricate and ordered structures.
      </p>

      <h2>Visualizing Langton's Ant</h2>
      <p>
        The live demonstration below showcases Langton's Ant in action. Start by
        observing the ant's chaotic movements on a randomly colored grid. As the
        simulation progresses, you'll witness the transition from disorder to a
        structured and predictable pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        The visual representation helps in understanding the dynamics of
        cellular automata and provides insights into how small changes in rules
        can lead to significant differences in outcomes.

      <h2>Applications and Implications</h2>
      <p>
        Langton's Ant serves as a simple yet powerful example of how
        computational processes can exhibit emergent behavior. Its study has
        implications for understanding complex systems, modeling artificial
        life, and even designing algorithms. Researchers use similar cellular
        automata models to explore and solve real-world problems, from traffic
        flow to biological systems.
